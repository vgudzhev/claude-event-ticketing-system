- Prompt 1 - The Backend Foundation
Prompt: "I want to build an Event Ticketing System. Using Kotlin and Spring Boot, please create a REST API.
Use H2 as a local file-based database.
Create an Event entity (id, title, date, totalTickets, price) and a Ticket entity (id, eventId, customerName, purchaseDate).
Provide a TicketService with a thread-safe method to 'purchase' a ticket (check availability, decrement totalTickets, and save the Ticket).
Include a Controller with endpoints to GET all events and POST a purchase."
